          <blockquote class="blockquote">"THE ADVICE I GIVE TO YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY IS EXACTLY WHAT MY MOTHER GAVE TO ME WHEN I WAS 10 AND I SAID I’M GOING TO GROW UP GO TO AFRICA, LIVE WITH WILD ANIMALS AND WRITE BOOKS ABOUT THEM. EVERYBODY LAUGHED. HOW COULD I DO THAT? WE DIDN’T HAVE ANY MONEY. WORLD WAR II WAS RAGING. I WAS JUST A GIRL. BUT MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAID, ‘IF YOU REALLY WANT SOMETHING, YOU’RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK HARD, YOU’LL HAVE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EVERY OPPORTUNITY BUT DON’T GIVE UP.’ I’VE TAKEN THAT MESSAGE TO YOUNG PEOPLE…ALL AROUND THE WORLD."<br><br>
